# shor
The Python quantum computing library.

Shor is a simple, modular, and extensible quantum computing API written in python.

#### Our mission is to make quantum computing easy and accesible to everyone.

Use shor if you need a library that:
- Enables fast prototyping of quantum circuits
- Simulates small quantum programs
- Makes quantum computing easy

We currently support running programs on Qiskit providers including IBMQ quantum computeres.

In the near future we plan to support other providers. Write your program once, and run it anywhere.

We are in early development and looking for contributors!

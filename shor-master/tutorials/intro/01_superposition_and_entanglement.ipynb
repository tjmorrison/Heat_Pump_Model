    "To understand these programs, and quantum computers in general, it is simpler to start with something familiar, everyday classical computers, and work our way up from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What is a computer?**\n",

    "\n",
    "Bits represent differences at the simplest level by enhabiting one of two possibilites: this or that, left or right, on or off, etc. A bit is a \"two state system\" and can represent any two things, states, or classes.\n",
